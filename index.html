<h1>The History</h1>
<h2>Football Freestyle is the art of performing tricks with a football.</h2>
<p>
However if you scratch the surface you’ll soon discover that it’s more than just tricks. For <strong>freestylers</strong> today it’s an art form, a sport and a <b>lifestyle.</b> It’s difficult to pin point the exact 
moment in time where freestyle truly began.

Over 2000 years ago games such as Chinlone, Jianzi and Sepak Takraw in Southern and South East Asia all embraced many skills that relate directly to the art and sport as we know it today, but 
where freestyle football really began to form was in the 20th century. When you think about fundamental freestyle tricks such as the <i><b>‘Neck Stall’</i></b> and <i><b>‘Around The World’</i></b>; These were first performed 
in the 1800’s by circus performers such as Enrico Rastelli and Francis Brunn. If you watch videos of their performances today you can see many similarities to every modern day freestyler.

<h3>Despite the tricks, this was not <strong>'freestyle football'</strong> - it was juggling.</h3>
<p>
It wasn’t <b>until the 1980’s</b> that freestyle became strongly associated to football. <b>Diego Maradona</b>, probably the best footballer in the world at that time, was the first person to perform these 
fundamental moves on a global stage and this pushed football freestyle into existence. Mr Woo and Kang Sung Min, two South Korean freestylers, would train with a football for up to 8 hours a day 
developing this new found art form. Later it was Mr Woo who carried <strong>freestyle football</strong> through the nineties virtually alone, showcasing <b>new tricks such as sole juggling</b> to audiences all over the 
world.
